Iterative methods for solving linear algebraic equations

Introduction
Gauss elimination was used to find the solution to the algebraic system of equations manually.
Once the solutions were found by hand, iterative methods were used in MATLAB to verify the
solutions. The iterative methods used was Gradient, Gauss-Seidel, and Jacobi methods. A
contour map and residual surface map was plotted for the first two set of equations. Five initial
guesses were used to show convergence to the same solution, x.

Results
Problem 1:
The solutions for the equations 1-3 using Gauss elimination is as follows:
x = [2; 1] for equation 1
x = [14/5; 2/5] for equation 2
x = [1; 1.5; 2.5] for equation 3

Conclusion
Gauss elimination was used to find solutions for the first three problems. Then the Gradient
method was used to find the solutions to equations one and two, Gauss-Seidel method was used
to find the solutions for equations 1, 2, and 3, and the Jacobi method was used to solve for
equation 3. The solutions for each method were the same for each equation. The Gauss-Seidel
method required less iterations over the Jacobi method.

Discussion
Gauss elimination can be used to find solutions to less complex equations. The methods used in
the homework will come in handy for more complex equations or solutions. Each method has
their own benefit.

Iterative methods for solving linear algebraic equations 2
Introduction
Part one uses different iterative solves to solve for three set of equations. Iterative methods are
used when Gauss elimination canâ€™t be used or less efficient. The iterative methods used were
Gradient, Gauss-Seidel, and Jacobi method. Part two involves visualizing linesearch to display a
2D section of the curve.

Conclusion
Different iterative methods were used to solve for the equations. The same solution resulted for
each equation. Linesearch used to plot a 2D plot of the contour plot. This helps to see the
solution easily.

Discussion
Iterative methods were studied more in this assignment because it is a useful tool when solving
for system of equations. Real world set of equations will be more extensive and this is where
iterative methods come into play.
